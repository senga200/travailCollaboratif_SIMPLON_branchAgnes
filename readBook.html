              One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
              himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on
              his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
              see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into
              stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed
              ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
              compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly
              as he looked.<br /><br />
              "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room,
              a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully
              between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples
              lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman -
              and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of
              an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.<br />
              It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat
              upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her
              lower arm towards the viewer.<br /><br />
              Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
              Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel
              quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget
              all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was
              unable to 3 do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and
              in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard
              he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he
              was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that
              he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped
              when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never
              felt before. "
